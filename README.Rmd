`r packageDescription("rtraining", fields = "Description")` The package is currently not yet functional, but you can read my [R Training Log](notebooks/r-training-log.Rmd) using the GitHub Pages URL: <https://jabenninghoff.github.io/rtraining/>.

## Installation

<!-- don't advertise CRAN install

You can install the released version of rtraining from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rtraining")
```

-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jabenninghoff/rtraining")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rtraining)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
