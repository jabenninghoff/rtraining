## Overview

**R Training:** My notes and experiences learning R and RStudio, bundled
as an R package (work-in-progress).

The package is currently not yet fully functional, but you can read my
[R Training Log](notebooks/r-training-log.Rmd) and [R Setup
Log](notebooks/r-setup-log.Rmd) using the GitHub Pages URL:
<https://jabenninghoff.github.io/rtraining/>.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jabenninghoff/rtraining")
```

Or using renv:

``` r
# install.packages("renv")
renv::install("jabenninghoff/rtraining")
```

## Development

-   Changelog: [NEWS](NEWS.md)
-   Planned: [TODO](TODO.md)
