Doing so will help you:\n\n* More accurately predict the performance and memory usage of your code. \n* Write faster code by avoiding accidental copies, a major source of slow code. \n* Better understand R's functional programming tools.\n\nThe goal of this chapter is to help you understand the distinction between names and values, and when R will copy an object.\n\n## 2 Quiz\n\n1.  Given the following data frame, how do I create a new column called \"3\"\n    that contains the sum of `1` and `2`? You may only use `$`, not `[[`.\n    What makes `1`, `2`, and `3` challenging as variable names?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- data.frame(runif(3), runif(3))\nnames(df) <- c(1, 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: use the following code.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf2 <- data.frame(df, df$`1` + df$`2`)\nnames(df2) <- c(1, 2, 3)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing numbers as names is problematic due to them being interpreted as numeric constants by default.\n\n---\n\n2.

Explain the relationship between `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` in the following \n    code:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 1:10\nb <- a\nc <- b\nd <- 1:10\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: a, b, and c all point to the same object (1:10). d points to an identical object at a different address.\n\nAR Solutions: `a`, `b`, and `c` point to the same object (with the same address in memory). This object has the value `1:10`. `d` points to a different object with the same value.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x11084d4d0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x11084d4d0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x11084d4d0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(d)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x120a14858\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n2.  The following code accesses the mean function in multiple ways. Do they all \n    point to the same underlying function object? Verify this with \n    `lobstr::obj_addr()`.\n    \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean\nbase::mean\nget(\"mean\")\nevalq(mean)\nmatch.fun(\"mean\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nCheck the `obj_addr`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(mean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x111b42fd0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(base::mean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x111b42fd0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(get(\"mean\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x111b42fd0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(evalq(mean))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x111b42fd0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(match.fun(\"mean\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x111b42fd0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: they do.\n\nAR Solutions: Yes, they point to the same object. We confirm this by inspecting the address of the underlying function object.\n\n---\n\n3.  By default, base R data import functions, like `read.csv()`, will \n    automatically convert non-syntactic names to syntactic ones. Why might \n    this be problematic? What option allows you to suppress this behaviour?\n\nAnswer: this could introduce problematic names, like `1`. Setting `check.names = FALSE` suppresses this behavior.\n\nAR Solutions: Column names are often data, and the underlying `make.names()` transformation is non-invertible, so the default behaviour corrupts data. To avoid this, set `check.names = FALSE`.\n\n---\n\n4.  What rules does `make.names()` use to convert non-syntactic names into\n    syntactic ones?\n\nAnswer: from `?make.names`:\n\n> The character \"X\" is prepended if necessary. All invalid characters are translated to \".\". A missing value is translated to \"NA\". Names which match R keywords have a dot appended to them. Duplicated values are altered by make.unique.\n\nAR Solutions: A valid name must start with a letter or a dot (not followed by a number) and may further contain numbers and underscores (`\"_\"`s are allowed since R version 1.9.0).\n\nThree main mechanisms ensure syntactically valid names (see `?make.names`):\n\n1. Names that do not start with a letter or a dot will be prepended with an `\"X\"`.\n   The same holds for names that begin with a dot followed by a number.\n2. Additionally, non-valid characters are replaced by a dot.\n3. Reserved R keywords (see `?reserved`) are suffixed by a dot.\n\nInterestingly, some of these transformations are influenced by the current locale. From `?make.names`:\n\n> The definition of a letter depends on the current locale, but only ASCII digits are considered to be digits.\n\n---\n\n5.  I slightly simplified the rules that govern syntactic names. Why is `.123e1`\n    not a syntactic name? Read `?make.names` for the full details.\n\nAnswer: from `?make.names`:\n\n> A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as \".2way\" are not valid, and neither are the reserved words.\n\nAR Solutions: `.123e1` is not a syntactic name, because it starts with one dot which is followed by a number. This makes it a double, `1.23`.\n\n---\n\n## 2.3.6 Exercises\n\n1.  Why is `tracemem(1:10)` not useful?\n\nAnswer: this is tracing an 'immutable' object which will always have the same address.\n\nAR Solutions: When `1:10` is called an object with an address in memory is created, but it is not bound to a name. Therefore, the object cannot be called or manipulated from R. As no copies will be made, it is not useful to track the object for copying.\n\n---\n\n2.  Explain why `tracemem()` shows two copies when you run this code.\n    Hint: carefully look at the difference between this code and the code \n    shown earlier in the section.\n     \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\nx <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)\ntracemem(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"<0x116a71848>\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx[[3]] <- 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> tracemem[0x116a71848 -> 0x116b4d108]: eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts <Anonymous> evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers <Anonymous> process_file <Anonymous> <Anonymous> execute .main \n#> tracemem[0x116b4d108 -> 0x116aebb58]: eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts <Anonymous> evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers <Anonymous> process_file <Anonymous> <Anonymous> execute .main\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuntracemem(x)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: unclear. The behavior in R 4.2.0 seems to have changed, since this code shows two copies:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\nx <- c(1, 2, 3)\ntracemem(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"<0x124874de8>\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- x\ny[[3]] <- 4L\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> tracemem[0x124874de8 -> 0x1248c0bb8]: eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts <Anonymous> evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers <Anonymous> process_file <Anonymous> <Anonymous> execute .main\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny[[3]] <- 5L\nuntracemem(x)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAR Solutions: Initially the vector `x` has integer type. The replacement call assigns a double to the third element of `x`, which triggers copy-on-modify.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)\ntracemem(x)\n#> <0x66a4a70>\n\nx[[3]] <- 4\n#> tracemem[0x55eec7b3af38 -> 0x55eec774cc18]:\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can avoid the copy by sub-assigning an integer instead of a double:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)\ntracemem(x)\n#> <0x55eec6940ae0>\n\nx[[3]] <- 4L\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlease be aware that running this code in RStudio will result in additional copies because of the reference from the environment pane.\n\n---\n\n3.  Sketch out the relationship between the following objects:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 1:10\nb <- list(a, a)\nc <- list(b, a, 1:10)\n\nprint(\"first object\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"first object\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124cc69b0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(b[[1]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124cc69b0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(b[[2]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124cc69b0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(c[[2]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124cc69b0\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"second object\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"second object\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124b0b888\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(c[[1]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124b0b888\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"third object\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"third object\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124e1af78\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"fourth object (?)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"fourth object (?)\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_addr(c[[3]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"0x124d22828\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: four different objects with multiple names.\n\nAR Solutions: `a` contains a reference to an address with the value `1:10`. `b` contains a list of two references to the same address as `a`. `c` contains a list of `b` (containing two references to `a`), `a` (containing the same reference again) and a reference pointing to a different address containing the same value (`1:10`).\n\n---\n\n4.  What happens when you run this code? Draw a picture.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- list(1:10)\n\nx[[2]] <- x\n\nref(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> █ [1:0x111832f88] <list> \n#> ├─[2:0x1151ab778] <int> \n#> └─█ [3:0x11221eea8] <list> \n#>   └─[2:0x1151ab778]\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInitially x is a list of one element, an int vector 1:10. Then a second list element is added, which points to the original int vector.\n\nAR Solutions: The initial reference tree of `x` shows that the name `x` binds to a list object. This object contains a reference to the integer vector `1:10`. When `x` is assigned to an element of itself, copy-on-modify takes place and the list is copied to a new address in memory. The list object previously bound to `x` is now referenced in the newly created list object. It is no longer bound to a name. The integer vector is referenced twice.\n\n---\n\n## 2.4.1 Exercises\n\n1.  In the following example, why are `object.size(y)` and `obj_size(y)`\n    so radically different? Consult the documentation of `object.size()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- rep(list(runif(1e4)), 100)\n\nobject.size(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 8005648 bytes\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_size(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 80.90 kB\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: `object.size()` \"does not detect if elements of a list are shared\", which is the case here. That is, it does not detect the list has been replicated 100 times, and overestimates by a factor of 100 compared to `object_size()`.\n\nAR Solutions: `object.size()` doesn't account for shared elements within lists. Therefore, the results differ by a factor of ~ 100.\n\n\n---\n\n2.  Take the following list. Why is its size somewhat misleading?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfuns <- list(mean, sd, var)\nobj_size(funs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 18.76 kB\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: it doesn't seem misleading to me, but the list includes the function objects, not the return values. Also, it calculates the size discarding the overlap between the functions. Per the code below, there is some:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobj_size(mean) + obj_size(sd) + obj_size(var)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 19.29 kB\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAR Solutions: All three functions are built-in to R as part of the `{base}` and `{stats}` packages and hence always available. So, what does it mean to measure the size of something that's already included in R?\n\n(There's typically a more general question about what you want to know when you ask for the size of something — do you want to know how much data you'd need to send to communicate the object to someone else (e.g. serialise it), or do you want to know how much memory you'd free if you deleted it?)\n\n---\n\n3.  Predict the output of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- runif(1e6)\nobj_size(a) # 8,000,048 B ~ 8MB\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 8.00 MB\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# correct: from example above, runif(1e6) ~= 8MB\n\nb <- list(a, a)\nobj_size(b) # slightly larger than obj_size(a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 8.00 MB\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# correct: two lists containing numeric vectors\nobj_size(a, b) # slightly larger than obj_size(b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 8.00 MB\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# wrong: a is entirely contained within b\n\nb[[1]][[1]] <- 10\nobj_size(b) # copy of b, same size\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 16.00 MB\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# wrong: double, since R copies an entire column, this adds the size of runif(1e6)\nobj_size(a, b) # still mostly overlaps, slightly larger than previous obj_size(a, b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 16.00 MB\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# wrong: a is still entirely contained with b\n\nb[[2]][[1]] <- 10\nobj_size(b) # copy of b, same size\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 16.00 MB\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# wrong: same size since it's still 2 numeric vectors of 1e6 length\nobj_size(a, b) # still mostly overlaps, slightly larger than previous obj_size(a, b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 24.00 MB\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# wrong: there is no longer any overlap, so the size of obj_size(a, b) = obj_size(a) = obj_size(b)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: answers inline.\n\nAR Solutions:\n\n`a <- runif(1e6)`:\n\n- In R (on most platforms) a length-0 vector has 48 bytes of overhead.\n- A single double takes up an additional 8 bytes of memory.\n- So, a 1 million double should take up 8,000,048 bytes.\n\nFor `b <- list(a, a)` both list elements contain references to the same memory address. Therefore, no additional memory is required for the second list element. The list itself requires 64 bytes, 48 bytes for an empty list and 8 bytes for each element (`obj_size(vector(\"list\", 2))`). This lets us predict 8,000,048 B + 64 B = 8,000,112 B.\n\n`b[[1]][[1]] <- 10`: When we modify the first element of `b[[1]]` copy-on-modify occurs. Both elements will still have the same size (8,000,040 B), but the first one gets a new address in memory. As `b`'s elements don't share references anymore, its object size adds up to the sum of the elements and the length-2 list: 8,000,048 B + 8,000,048 B + 64 B = 16,000,160 B (16 MB). The second element of `b` still references the same address as `a`, so the combined size of `a` and `b` is the same as `b`.\n\n`b[[2]][[1]] <- 10`: When we modify the second element of `b`, this element will also point to a new memory address. This does not affect the size of the list. However, as `b` doesn't share references with `a` anymore, the memory usage of the combined objects increases.\n\n---\n\n## 2.5.3 Exercises\n\n1.  Explain why the following code doesn't create a circular list.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- list()\nx[[1]] <- x\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: the name x is assigned to the empty list, and then the first element of x is mapped to the object that x points to, the empty list.\n\nAR Solutions: In this situation copy-on-modify prevents the creation of a circular list.

With 20, the list method is 5 times as fast. So, the list method is near constant time regardless of columns, whereas the data.frame method scales linearly with the number of columns.\n\nAR Solutions:\n\nWhen working directly with the data frame, the execution time grows quadratically with the number of columns in the input data. This is because (e.g.) the first column must be copied n times, the second column n-1 times, and so on. When working with a list, the execution time increases only linearly.\n\nObviously in the long run, linear growth creates shorter run-times, but there is some cost to this strategy — we have to convert between data structures with as.list() and list2DF(). Even though this is fast and probably doesn’t hurt much, the improved approach doesn’t really pay off in this scenario until we get to a data frame that is about 300 columns wide (with the exact value depending on the characteristics of the system running the code).\n\n---\n\n3.

Environments are always modified in place.\n\n---\n\n# 3 Vectors\n\nThis chapter discusses the most important family of data types in base R: vectors. While you've probably already used many (if not all) of the different types of vectors, you may not have thought deeply about how they're interrelated. In this chapter, I won't cover individual vectors types in too much detail, but I will show you how all the types fit together as a whole. If you need more details, you can find them in R's documentation.\n\nVectors come in two flavours: atomic vectors and lists. They differ in terms of their elements' types: for atomic vectors, all elements must have the same type; for lists, elements can have different types. While not a vector, `NULL` is closely related to vectors and often serves the role of a generic zero length vector. This diagram, which we'll be expanding on throughout this chapter, illustrates the basic relationships:\n\nEvery vector can also have __attributes__, which you can think of as a named list of arbitrary metadata. Two attributes are particularly important. The __dimension__ attribute turns vectors into matrices and arrays and the __class__ attribute powers the S3 object system. While you'll learn how to use S3 in Chapter 13, here you'll learn about some of the most important S3 vectors: factors, date and times, data frames, and tibbles. And while 2D structures like matrices and data frames are not necessarily what come to mind when you think of vectors, you'll also learn why R considers them to be vectors.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3.2.5 Exercises\n\n1. How do you create raw and complex scalars? (See `?raw` and \n   `?complex`.)\n\nAnswer: using either `raw()`, `complex()`, or `as.raw()`, `as.complex()`.\n\nAR Solutions: In R, scalars are represented as vectors of length one. However, there's no built-in syntax like there is for logicals, integers, doubles, and character vectors to create individual raw and complex values. Instead, you have to create them by calling a function. For raw vectors you can use either `as.raw()` or `charToRaw()` to create them from numeric or character values.\n\nIn the case of complex numbers, real and imaginary parts may be provided directly to the `complex()` constructor. You can create purely imaginary numbers (e.g.) `1i`, but there is no way to create complex numbers without `+` (e.g. `1i + 1`).\n\n---\n\n2. Test your knowledge of the vector coercion rules by predicting the output of\n   the following uses of `c()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(1, FALSE) # 1.0, 0.0 - double\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(\"a\", 1) # \"a\", \"1\" - character\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"a\" \"1\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(TRUE, 1L) # 1L, 1L - integer\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(c(1, FALSE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"double\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(c(\"a\", 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(c(TRUE, 1L))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"integer\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: guesses inline.

Why is `1 == \"1\"` true? Why is `-1 < FALSE` true? Why is `\"one\" < 2` false?\n\nAnswers:\n\n- `1 == \"1\"`: the 1 is coerced to \"1\"\n- `-1 < FALSE`: FALSE is coerced to 0\n- `\"one\" < 2: the 2 is coerced to \"2\"\n\n\nAR Solutions: These comparisons are carried out by operator-functions (`==`, `<`), which coerce their arguments to a common type. In the examples above, these types will be character, double and character: `1` will be coerced to `\"1\"`, `FALSE` is represented as `0` and `2` turns into `\"2\"` (and numbers precede letters in lexicographic order (may depend on locale)).\n\n---\n\n4. Why is the default missing value, `NA`, a logical vector? What's special\n   about logical vectors? (Hint: think about `c(FALSE, NA_character_)`.)\n\nAnswer: NA must be logical so that it can exist in a logical vector.\n\nAR Solutions: The presence of missing values shouldn't affect the type of an object. Recall that there is a type-hierarchy for coercion from character → double → integer → logical. When combining `NA`s  with other atomic types, the `NA`s will be coerced to integer (`NA_integer_`), double (`NA_real_`) or character (`NA_character_`) and not the other way round.  If `NA` were a character and added to a set of other values all of these would be coerced to character as well.\n\n---\n\n5. Precisely what do `is.atomic()`, `is.numeric()`, and `is.vector()` test for?\n\nAnswers:\n\n- `is.atomic(x)`: tests if x is an atomic vector (logical, integer, numeric, complex, character,\n  and raw) - is `FALSE` for lists\n- `is.numeric(x)`: tests if x is an atomic numeric vector\n- `is.vector(x, mode = \"any\")`: tests if x is an atomic vector OR a list or expression\n\nAR Solutions: The documentation states that:\n\n- `is.atomic()` tests if an object is an atomic vector (as defined in *Advanced R*) or is `NULL` (!).\n- `is.numeric()` tests if an object has type integer or double and is not of class `factor`, `Date`, `POSIXt` or `difftime`.\n- `is.vector()` tests if an object is a vector (as defined in *Advanced R*) or an expression and has no attributes, apart from names.\n\nAtomic vectors are defined in *Advanced R* as objects of type logical, integer, double, complex, character or raw. Vectors are defined as atomic vectors or lists.\n\n---\n\n## 3.3.4 Exercises\n\n1.  How is `setNames()` implemented?

It is implemented as an integer vector with class `table` and dimensions (which makes it act like an array). Its attributes are `dim` (dimensions) and `dimnames` (one name for each input column). The dimensions correspond to the number of unique values (factor levels) in each input variable.\n\n---\n\n2.

List all the ways that a list differs from an atomic vector.\n\nAnswers:\n\n- Each element can be a different type\n- Each element is a reference to an object\n- List size can be smaller since elements are references\n- Lists can contain other lists\n\nAR Solutions: To summarise:\n\n- Atomic vectors are always homogeneous (all elements must be of the same type). Lists may be heterogeneous (the elements can be of different types) as described in the [introduction of the vectors chapter](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#introduction).\n- Atomic vectors point to one address in memory, while lists contain a separate reference for each element. (This was described in the list sections of the [vectors](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#lists) and the [names and values](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#list-references) chapters.)\n- Subsetting with out-of-bounds and `NA` values leads to different output. For example, `[` returns `NA` for atomics and `NULL` for lists. (This is described in more detail within the [subsetting chapter](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html).)\n\n---\n\n2.  Why do you need to use `unlist()` to convert a list to an \n    atomic vector? Why doesn't `as.vector()` work? \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nis.vector(list(1:4))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndput(as.vector(list(1:4)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> list(1:4)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: a list is considered a vector by `as.vector()`.\n\nAR Solutions: A list is already a vector, though not an atomic one!\n\n---\n\n3.

While dates store the number of days since the reference date 1970-01-01 (also known as “the Epoch”) in days, date-time-objects (POSIXct) store the time difference to this date in seconds.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndate <- as.Date(\"1970-01-02\")\ndttm_ct <- as.POSIXct(\"1970-01-01 01:00\", tz = \"UTC\")\n# Internal representations\nunclass(date)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunclass(dttm_ct)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 3600\n#> attr(,\"tzone\")\n#> [1] \"UTC\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs the `c()` generic only dispatches on its first argument, combining date and date-time objects via `c()` could lead to surprising results in older R versions (pre R 4.0.0):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Output in R version 3.6.2\nc(date, dttm_ct) # equal to c.Date(date, dttm_ct)\n#> [1] \"1970-01-02\" \"1979-11-10\"\nc(dttm_ct, date) # equal to c.POSIXct(date, dttm_ct)\n#> [1] \"1970-01-01 02:00:00 CET\" \"1970-01-01 01:00:01 CET\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the first statement above `c.Date()` is executed, which incorrectly treats the underlying double of `dttm_ct` (3600) as days instead of seconds. Conversely, when `c.POSIXct()` is called on a date, one day is counted as one second only.\n\nWe can highlight these mechanics by the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Output in R version 3.6.2\nunclass(c(date, dttm_ct)) # internal representation\n#> [1] 1 3600\ndate + 3599\n#> \"1979-11-10\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs of R 4.0.0 these issues have been resolved and both methods now convert their input first into `POSIXct` and `Date`, respectively.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(dttm_ct, date)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"1970-01-01 01:00:00 UTC\" \"1970-01-02 00:00:00 UTC\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunclass(c(dttm_ct, date))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1]  3600 86400\n#> attr(,\"tzone\")\n#> [1] \"UTC\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(date, dttm_ct)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"1970-01-02\" \"1970-01-01\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunclass(c(date, dttm_ct))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, as `c()` strips the time zone (and other attributes) of `POSIXct` objects, some caution is still recommended.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(dttm_ct <- as.POSIXct(\"1970-01-01 01:00\", tz = \"HST\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"1970-01-01 01:00:00 HST\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nattributes(c(dttm_ct))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> $class\n#> [1] \"POSIXct\" \"POSIXt\" \n#> \n#> $tzone\n#> [1] \"HST\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA package that deals with these kinds of problems in more depth and provides a structural solution for them is the [`vctrs` package](https://github.com/r-lib/vctrs) which is also used throughout the tidyverse.\n\nLet's look at `unlist()`, which operates on list input.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Attributes are stripped\nunlist(list(date, dttm_ct))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1]     1 39600\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see again that dates and date-times are internally stored as doubles. Unfortunately, this is all we are left with, when unlist strips the attributes of the list.\n\nTo summarise: `c()` coerces types and strips time zones. Errors may have occurred in older R versions because of inappropriate method dispatch/immature methods. `unlist()` strips attributes.\n\n---\n\n## 3.6.8 Exercises\n\n1.

Otherwise the usual coercion hierarchy (logical < integer < double < complex) will be used, e.g. all-logical data frames will be coerced to a logical matrix, mixed logical-integer will give an integer matrix, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, `data.matrix` will always return a numeric matrix (see `?data.matrix()`).\n\n> Return the matrix obtained by converting all the variables in a data frame to numeric mode and then binding them together as the columns of a matrix. Factors and ordered factors are replaced by their internal codes. [...] Character columns are first converted to factors and then to integers.\n\nWe can illustrate and compare the mechanics of these functions using a concrete example. `as.matrix()` makes it possible to retrieve most of the original information from the data frame but leaves us with characters. To retrieve all information from `data.matrix()`'s output, we would need a lookup table for each column.\n\n---\n\n# 4 Subsetting\n\nR's subsetting operators are fast and powerful. Mastering them allows you to succinctly perform complex operations in a way that few other languages can match. Subsetting in R is easy to learn but hard to master because you need to internalise a number of interrelated concepts:\n\n* There are six ways to subset atomic vectors.\n\n* There are three subsetting operators, `[[`, `[`, and `$`.\n\n* Subsetting operators interact differently with different vector \n  types (e.g., atomic vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).\n\n* Subsetting can be combined with assignment.\n\nSubsetting is a natural complement to `str()`. While `str()` shows you all the pieces of any object (its structure), subsetting allows you to pull out the pieces that you're interested in. For large, complex objects, I highly recommend using the interactive RStudio Viewer, which you can activate with `View(my_object)`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 4.2.6 Exercises\n\n1.

This is subsetting by matrix, which is new.\n\nAR Solutions: `upper.tri(x)` returns a logical matrix, which contains `TRUE` values above the diagonal and `FALSE` values everywhere else. In `upper.tri()` the positions for `TRUE` and `FALSE` values are determined by comparing `x`'s row and column indices via `.row(dim(x)) < .col(dim(x))`.\n\nWhen subsetting with logical matrices, all elements that correspond to `TRUE` will be selected. Matrices extend vectors with a dimension attribute, so the vector forms of subsetting can be used (including logical subsetting). We should take care, that the dimensions of the subsetting matrix match the object of interest — otherwise unintended selections due to vector recycling may occur. Please also note, that this form of subsetting returns a vector instead of a matrix, as the subsetting alters the dimensions of the object.\n\n---\n\n4.  Why does `mtcars[1:20]` return an error?

So, `mtcars[1:20]` would return a data frame containing the first 20 columns of the dataset. However, as `mtcars` has only 11 columns, the index will be out of bounds and an error is thrown. `mtcars[1:20, ]` is subsetted with two vectors, so 2d subsetting kicks in, and the first index refers to rows.\n\n---\n\n5.

Choices, like `if` statements and `switch()` calls, allow you to run different code depending on the input. Loops, like `for` and `while`, allow you to repeatedly run code, typically with changing options. I'd expect that you're already familiar with the basics of these functions so I'll briefly cover some technical details and then introduce some useful, but lesser known, features.\n\nThe condition system (messages, warnings, and errors), which you'll learn about in Chapter 8, also provides non-local control flow. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 5.2.4 Exercises\n\n1.  What type of vector does each of the following calls to `ifelse()`\n    return?

In general, `ifelse()` returns the entry for `yes` when `test` is `TRUE`, the entry for `no` when `test` is `FALSE` and `NA` when `test` is `NA`. Therefore, the expressions above return vectors of type `double` (`1`), `character` (`\"no\"`) and `logical` (`NA`).\n\nTo be a little more precise, we will cite the part of the documentation on the return value of `ifelse()`:\n\n> A vector of the same length and attributes (including dimensions and \"class\") as test and data values from the values of yes or no. The mode of the answer will be coerced from logical to accommodate first any values taken from yes and then any values taken from no.\n\nThis is surprising because it uses the type of `test`. In practice this means, that `test` is first converted to logical and if the result is neither `TRUE` nor `FALSE`, simply `as.logical(test)` is returned.\n\n---\n\n2.  Why does the following code work?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1:10\nif (length(x)) \"not empty\" else \"empty\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"not empty\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- numeric()\nif (length(x)) \"not empty\" else \"empty\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"empty\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: in the first example, `length(x)` is nonzero, which evaluates to `TRUE`. In the second example, `numeric()` returns a vector of length 0 (the default), `length(x)` is zero, which evaluates to `FALSE`.\n\nAR Solutions: `if()` expects a logical condition, but also accepts a numeric vector where `0` is treated as `FALSE` and all other numbers are treated as `TRUE`. Numerical missing values (including `NaN`) lead to an error in the same way that a logical missing, `NA`, does.\n\n---\n\n## 5.3.3 Exercises\n\n1.  Why does this code succeed without errors or warnings? \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- numeric() # x is numeric(0)\nout <- vector(\"list\", length(x)) # out is list(0)\nfor (i in 1:length(x)) { # nolint: seq_linter. i is 1, then 0.\n  out[i] <- x[i]^2 # when i = 1 x[1] is NA, sets out[1] to NA. when i = 0 nothing happens\n}\nout\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [[1]]\n#> [1] NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: in addition to notes above, `out[0]` and `x[0]` return a zero-length vector.\n\nAR Solutions: This loop is a delicate issue, and we have to consider a few points to explain why it is evaluated without raising any errors or warnings.\n\nThe beginning of this code smell is the statement `1:length(x)` which creates the index of the for loop. As `x` has length 0 `1:length(x)` counts down from 1 to 0. This issue is typically avoided via usage of `seq_along(x)` or similar helpers which would just generate `integer(0)` in this case.\n\nAs we use `[<-` and `[` for indexing 0-length vectors at their first and zeroth position, we need to be aware of their subsetting behaviour for out-of-bounds and zero indices.\n\nDuring the first iteration `x[1]` will generate an `NA` (out-of-bounds indexing for atomics). The resulting `NA` (from squaring) will be assigned to the empty length-1 list `out[1]` (out-of-bounds indexing for lists).\n\nIn the next iteration, `x[0]` will return `numeric(0)` (zero indexing for atomics). Again, squaring doesn't change the value and `numeric(0)` is assigned to `out[0]` (zero indexing for lists). Assigning a 0-length vector to a 0-length subset works but doesn't change the object.\n\nOverall, the code works, because each step includes valid R operations (even though the result may not be what the user intended).\n\n---\n\n2.  When the following code is evaluated, what can you say about the \n    vector being iterated?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxs <- c(1, 2, 3)\nfor (x in xs) {\n  xs <- c(xs, x * 2)\n}\nxs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1 2 3 2 4 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: `x` iterates from 1 to 3, and is not affected by changes to `xs` during the loop, while `xs` is updated.\n\nAR Solution: In this loop `x` takes on the values of the initial `xs` (`1`, `2` and `3`), indicating that it is evaluated just once in the beginning of the loop, not after each iteration. (Otherwise, we would run into an infinite loop.)\n\n---\n\n3.  What does the following code tell you about when the index is updated?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (i in 1:3) {\n  i <- i * 2\n  print(i)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 2\n#> [1] 4\n#> [1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: the index is updated at the beginning of each loop.\n\nAR Solutions: In a for loop the index is updated in the beginning of each iteration. Therefore, reassigning the index symbol during one iteration doesn't affect the following iterations. (Again, we would otherwise run into an infinite loop.)\n\n---\n\n# 6 Functions\n\nIf you're reading this book, you've probably already created many R functions and know how to use them to reduce duplication in your code.

How do you ensure that cleanup action occurs regardless of how a function \n    exits? a: ??? [`on.exit()`]\n\n## 6.2.5 Exercises\n\n1. Given a name, like `\"mean\"`, `match.fun()` lets you find a function. \n   Given a function, can you find its name? Why doesn't that make sense in R?\n\nAnswer: a function is an object and could have multiple names pointing to it.\n\nAR Solutions: In R there is no one-to-one mapping between functions and names. A name always points to a single object, but an object may have zero, one or many names.\n\n---\n\n2.  It's possible (although typically not useful) to call an anonymous function.\n    Which of the two approaches below is correct? Why?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" result='hide'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfunction(x) 3()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> function (x) \n#> 3()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(function(x) 3)()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: The second is correct, as the first is the form of defining a function.\n\nAR Solutions: The second approach is correct.\n\nThe anonymous function `function(x) 3` is surrounded by a pair of parentheses before it is called by `()`. These extra parentheses separate the function call from the anonymous function's body. Without them a function with the invalid body `3()` is returned, which throws an error when we call it.\n\n---\n\n3. A good rule of thumb is that an anonymous function should fit on one line \n   and shouldn't need to use `{}`. Review your code. Where could you have \n   used an anonymous function instead of a named function? Where should you \n   have used a named function instead of an anonymous function?\n\nAnswer: in `rdev::build_analysis_site()`, `analysis_menu_item()` is properly written as a named function, where `get_component()` could be written as an anonymous function, with `dir_check_copy()` and `dir_check_delete()` potentially either.\n\nAR Solutions: The use of anonymous functions allows concise and elegant code in certain situations. However, they miss a descriptive name and when re-reading the code, it can take a while to figure out what they do. That's why it's helpful to give long and complex functions a descriptive name. It may be worthwhile to take a look at your own projects or other people's code to reflect on this part of your coding style.\n\n---\n\n4.  What function allows you to tell if an object is a function? What function\n    allows you to tell if a function is a primitive function?\n\nAnswer: `is.function()` and `is.primitive()`.\n\nAR Solutions: Use `is.function()` to test if an object is a function. Consider using `is.primitive()` to test specifically for primitive functions.\n\n---\n\n5.

the `ls()` in the original code could be expanded to search all packages\n\nAR Solutions: Let's look at each sub-question separately:\n\na. To find the function with the most arguments, we first compute the length of `formals()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nn_args <- funs %>%\n  map(formals) %>%\n  map_int(length)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we sort `n_args` in decreasing order and look at its first entries.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_args %>%\n  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%\n  head()\n#> scan format.default source\n#> 22 16 16\n#> formatC library merge.data.frame\n#> 15 13 13\n```\n:::\n\n\nb.

To fix this, we can first remove the primitive functions:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_args2 <- funs %>%\n  discard(is.primitive) %>%\n  map(formals) %>%\n  map_int(length)\n\nsum(n_args2 == 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 48\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIndeed, most of the functions with no arguments are actually primitive functions.\n\nc.

What are the three important components of a function?\n\nAnswer: the `formals()`, `body()` and `environment()`.\n\nAR Solutions: These components are the function's `body()`, `formals()` and `environment()`. However, as mentioned in *Advanced R*:\n\n> There is one exception to the rule that functions have three components. Primitive functions, like `sum()`, call C code directly with `.Primitive()` and contain no R code. Therefore, their `formals()`, `body()`, and `environment()` are all `NULL`.\n\n---\n\n7. When does printing a function not show the environment it was created in?\n\nAnswer: when it is created in the global environment.\n\nAR Solutions: Primitive functions and functions created in the global environment do not print their environment.\n\n---\n\n## 6.4.5 Exercises\n\n1. What does the following code return? Why? Describe how each of the three\n   `c`'s is interpreted.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc <- 10\nc(c = c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>  c \n#> 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: a named vector, `c 10`. The first and final c is a variable. The second c is a function name. the third c is a name.\n\nAR Solutions: This code returns a named numeric vector of length one — with one element of the value `10` and the name `\"c\"`. The first `c` represents the `c()` function, the second `c` is interpreted as a (quoted) name and the third `c` as a value.\n\n---\n\n2. What are the four principles that govern how R looks for values?\n\nAnswer: name masking, functions versus variables, a fresh start, dynamic lookup.\n\nAR Solutions: R's [lexical scoping](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#lexical-scoping) rules are based on these four principles:\n- [Name masking](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#name-masking)\n- [Functions vs. variables](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#functions-versus-variables)\n- [A fresh start](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#fresh-start)\n- [Dynamic lookup](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#dynamic-lookup)\n\n---\n\n3. What does the following function return? Make a prediction before \n   running the code yourself.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf <- function(x) {\n  f <- function(x) { # return value of this is 101\n    f <- function() {\n      x^2\n    }\n    f() + 1\n  }\n  f(x) * 2\n}\nf(10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 202\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: 202. Correct!\n\nAR Solutions: Within this nested function two more functions also named `f` are defined and called. Because the functions are each executed in their own environment R will look up and use the functions defined last in these environments. The innermost `f()` is called last, though it is the first function to return a value. Therefore, the order of the calculation passes \"from the inside to the outside\" and the function returns `((10 ^ 2) + 1) * 2`, i.e. 202.\n\n---\n\n## 6.5.4 Exercises\n\n1.  What important property of `&&` makes `x_ok()` work?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_ok <- function(x) {\n  !is.null(x) && length(x) == 1 && x > 0\n}\n\nx_ok(NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_ok(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_ok(1:3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: From the `&&` docs, \"The longer forms evaluates left to right, proceeding only until the result is determined.\"\n\nWhat is different with this code? Why is this behaviour undesirable here?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_ok <- function(x) {\n  !is.null(x) & length(x) == 1 & x > 0\n}\n\nx_ok(NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> logical(0)\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_ok(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_ok(1:3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: \"The shorter forms performs elementwise comparisons in much the same way as arithmetic operators.\" This is undesirable because the intent of the function is to return `TRUE` or `FALSE`.\n\nAR Solutions: In summary: `&&` short-circuits which means that if the left-hand side is `FALSE` it doesn't evaluate the right-hand side (because it doesn't matter). Similarly, if the left-hand side of `||` is `TRUE` it doesn't evaluate the right-hand side.\n\nWe expect `x_ok()` to validate its input via certain criteria: it must not be `NULL`, have length `1` and be greater than `0`. Meaningful outcomes for this assertion will be `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `NA`. The desired behaviour is reached by combining the assertions through `&&` instead of `&`.\n\n`&&` does not perform elementwise comparisons; instead it uses the first element of each value only. It also uses lazy evaluation, in the sense that evaluation \"proceeds only until the result is determined\" (from `?Logic`). This means that the RHS of `&&` won't be evaluated if the LHS already determines the outcome of the comparison (e.g. evaluate to `FALSE`). This behaviour is also known as \"short-circuiting\". For some situations (`x = 1`) both operators will lead to the same result. But this is not always the case. For `x = NULL`, the `&&`-operator will stop after the `!is.null` statement and return the result. The following conditions won't even be evaluated! (If the other conditions are also evaluated (by the use of `&`), the outcome would change. `NULL > 0` returns `logical(0)`, which is not helpful in this case.)\n\nWe can also see the difference in behaviour, when we set `x = 1:3`. The `&&`-operator returns the result from `length(x) == 1`, which is `FALSE`. Using `&` as the logical operator leads to the (vectorised) `x > 0` condition being evaluated and also returned.\n\n---\n\n2.  What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf2 <- function(x = z) {\n  z <- 100\n  x\n}\nf2()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 100\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: 100, lazy evaluation. `x = z` isn't evaluated until `x`.\n\nAR Solutions: The function returns 100. The default argument (`x = z`) gets lazily evaluated within the function environment when `x` gets accessed. At this time `z` has already been bound to the value `100`. The illustrated principle here is *lazy evaluation*.\n\n---\n\n3.  What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- 10\n# styler: off\nf1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) { # nolint: semicolon_linter.\n  # styler: on\n  c(x, y)\n}\nf1()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 2 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 10\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: `c(2, 1)`. default arguments.\n\nAR Solutions: The function returns `c(2, 1)` which is due to *name masking*. When `x` is accessed within `c()`, the promise `x = {y <- 1; 2}` is evaluated inside `f1()`'s environment. `y` gets bound to the value `1` and the return value of `{()` (`2`) gets assigned to `x`. When `y` gets accessed next within `c()`, it has already the value `1` and R doesn't need to look it up any further. Therefore, the promise `y = 0` won't be evaluated. Also, as `y` is assigned within `f1()`'s environment, the value of the global variable `y` is left untouched.\n\n---\n\n4.  In `hist()`, the default value of `xlim` is `range(breaks)`, the default \n    value for `breaks` is `\"Sturges\"`, and\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrange(\"Sturges\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"Sturges\" \"Sturges\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExplain how `hist()` works to get a correct `xlim` value.\n\nAnswer: from the docs, \"Note that `xlim` is *not* used to define the histogram (breaks), but only for plotting (when `plot = TRUE`).\" So, the breakpoints are calculated when the object is created, and `xlim` is calculated when the histogram is plotted, in the second step.\n\nAR Solutions: The `xlim` argument of `hist()` defines the range of the histogram's x-axis. In order to provide a valid axis `xlim` must contain a numeric vector of exactly two unique values. Consequently, for the default `xlim = range(breaks)`), `breaks` must evaluate to a vector with at least two unique values.\n\nDuring execution `hist()` overwrites the `breaks` argument. The `breaks` argument is quite flexible and allows the users to provide the breakpoints directly or compute them in several ways. Therefore, the specific behaviour depends highly on the input. But `hist` ensures that `breaks` evaluates to a numeric vector containing at least two unique elements before `xlim` is computed.\n\n---\n    \n5.  Explain why this function works. Why is it confusing?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshow_time <- function(x = stop(\"Error!\")) {\n  stop <- function(...) Sys.time()\n  print(x)\n}\nshow_time()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"2025-11-12 14:35:10 CST\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: `stop` is redefined before `x` is evaluated. This is a confusing use of lazy evaluation.\n\nAR Solutions: Before `show_time()` accesses `x` (default `stop(\"Error\")`), the `stop()` function is masked by `function(...) Sys.time()`. As default arguments are evaluated in the function environment, `print(x)` will be evaluated as `print(Sys.time())`.\n\nThis function is confusing because its behaviour changes when `x`'s value is supplied directly. Now the value from the calling environment will be used and the overwriting of `stop()` won't affect `x` anymore.\n\n---\n\n6.  How many arguments are required when calling `library()`?\n\nAnswer: zero. `library()` uses `missing()` to return the list of available packages if there are no arguments.\n\nAR Solutions: `library()` doesn't require any arguments. When called without arguments `library()` invisibly returns a list of class `libraryIQR`, which contains a results matrix with one row and three columns per installed package. These columns contain entries for the name of the package (\"Package\"), the path to the package (\"LibPath\") and the title of the package (\"Title\"). `library()` also has its own print method (`print.libraryIQR()`), which displays this information conveniently in its own window.\n\nThis behaviour is also documented under the details section of `library()`'s help page (`?library`):\n\n> If library is called with no package or help argument, it lists all available packages in the libraries specified by lib.loc, and returns the corresponding information in an object of class “libraryIQR”. (The structure of this class may change in future versions.) Use .packages(all = TRUE) to obtain just the names of all available packages, and installed.packages() for even more information.\n\nBecause the `package` and `help` argument from `library()` do not show a default value, it's easy to overlook the possibility to call `library()` without these arguments. (Instead of providing `NULL`s as default values `library()` uses `missing()` to check if these arguments were provided.)\n\n---\n\n## 6.6.1 Exercises\n\n1.  Explain the following results:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 7\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n- \"`sum()` returns the sum of all the values present in its arguments.\" The first example is\n  straightforward. In the second sum example, `na.omit` isn't a valid argument (`na.rm` is), so the\n  `TRUE` value is passed to `...`, coerced to 1, and included in the sum.\n- `mean()` takes a single parameter, and passes on remaining arguments to `...`. In both cases, the\n  arguments after the `1` are silently dropped. The correct form would be `mean(c(1, 2, 3))`.\n\nAR Solutions: Let's inspect the arguments and their order for both functions. For `sum()` these are `...` and `na.rm`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(sum)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> function (..., na.rm = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nFor the `...` argument `sum()` expects numeric, complex, or logical vector input (see `?sum`). Unfortunately, when `...` is used, misspelled arguments (!) like `na.omit` won't raise an error (in case of no further input checks). So instead, `na.omit` is treated as a logical and becomes part of the `...` argument. It will be coerced to `1` and be part of the sum. All other arguments are left unchanged. Therefore `sum(1, 2, 3)` returns `6` and `sum(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)` returns `7`.\n\nIn contrast, the generic function `mean()` expects `x`, `trim`, `na.rm` and `...` for its default method.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(mean.default)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> function (x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs `na.omit` is not one of `mean()`'s named arguments (`x`; and no candidate for partial matching), `na.omit` again becomes part of the `...` argument. However, in contrast to `sum()` the elements of `...` are not \"part\" of the mean. The other supplied arguments are matched by their order, i.e. `x = 1`, `trim = 2` and `na.rm = 3`. As `x` is of length 1 and not `NA`, the settings of `trim` and `na.rm` do not affect the calculation of the mean. Both calls (`mean(1, 2, 3)` and `mean(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)`) return `1`.\n\n---\n\n2.

There we can find information for the `xlab` argument and a recommendation to visit `?par` for the other arguments. Under `?par` we type \"col\" into the search bar, which leads us to the section \"Color Specification\". We also search for the `pch` argument, which leads to the recommendation to check `?points`. Finally, `col.lab` is also directly documented within `?par`.\n\n---\n\n3.  Why does `plot(1:10, col = \"red\")` only colour the points, not the axes \n    or labels? Read the source code of `plot.default()` to find out.\n\n```r\nlocalAxis <- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) Axis(...)\nlocalBox <- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) box(...)\nlocalWindow <- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) plot.window(...)\nlocalTitle <- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) title(...)\n```\n\nAnswer: `plot.default()` discards `col` and several other arguments when calling `Axis()`, `box()`, `plot.window()`, and `title()`.\n\nAR Solutions: To learn about the internals of `plot.default()` we add `browser()` to the first line of the code and interactively run `plot(1:10, col = \"red\")`. This way we can see how the plot is built and learn where the axes are added.\nThis leads us to the function call\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlocalTitle(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, ...)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `localTitle()` function was defined in the first lines of `plot.default()` as:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlocalTitle <- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) title(...)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe call to `localTitle()` passes the `col` parameter as part of the `...` argument to `title()`. `?title` tells us that the `title()` function specifies four parts of the plot: Main (title of the plot), sub (sub-title of the plot) and both axis labels. Therefore, it would introduce ambiguity inside `title()` to use `col` directly. Instead, one has the option to supply `col` via the `...` argument, via `col.lab` or as part of `xlab` in the form `xlab = list(c(\"index\"), col = \"red\")` (similar for `ylab`).\n\n---\n\n## 6.7.5 Exercises\n\n1.  What does `load()` return? Why don't you normally see these values?\n\nAnswer: from the docs, `load()` returns \"A character vector of the names of objects created, invisibly.\"\n\nAR Solutions: `load()` loads objects saved to disk in `.Rdata` files by `save()`. When run successfully, `load()` invisibly returns a character vector containing the names of the newly loaded objects. To print these names to the console, one can set the argument `verbose` to `TRUE` or surround the call in parentheses to trigger R's auto-printing mechanism.\n\n---\n\n2.  What does `write.table()` return? What would be more useful?\n\nAnswer: it returns `invisible(NULL)`. Returning the written table or the argument `x` would be more useful.\n\nAR Solutions: `write.table()` writes an object, usually a data frame or a matrix, to disk. The function invisibly returns `NULL`. It would be more useful if `write.table()` would (invisibly) return the input data, `x`. This would allow to save intermediate results and directly take on further processing steps without breaking the flow of the code (i.e. breaking it into different lines). One package which uses this pattern is the `{readr}` package, which is part of the [tidyverse-ecosystem](https://tidyverse.org/).\n\n---\n\n3.  How does the `chdir` parameter of `source()` compare to `with_dir()`? Why \n    might you prefer one to the other?\n\nAnswer: both temporarily change the working directory. `chdir` is preferable since this is expected behavior for the function, unless you need to set a working directory other than the directory containing `file`.\n\nAR Solutions: `with_dir()` takes a path for a working directory (`dir`) as its first argument. This is the directory where the provided code (`code`) should be executed. Therefore, the current working directory is changed in `with_dir()` via `setwd()`. Then, `on.exit()` ensures that the modification of the working directory is reset to the initial value when the function exits. By passing the path explicitly, the user has full control over the directory to execute the code in.\n\nIn `source()` the code is passed via the `file` argument (a path to a file). The `chdir` argument specifies if the working directory should be changed to the directory containing the file. The default for `chdir` is `FALSE`, so you don't have to provide a value. However, as you can only provide `TRUE` or `FALSE`, you are also less flexible in choosing the working directory for the code execution.\n\n---\n\n4.  Write a function that opens a graphics device, runs the supplied code, and \n    closes the graphics device (always, regardless of whether or not the \n    plotting code works).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith_png <- function(code, ...) {\n  png(...)\n  on.exit(dev.off(), add = TRUE, after = TRUE)\n  force(code)\n}\n\nwith_png(\n  plot(1:10),\n  filename = \"rendered/withpng-example.png\",\n  # use 3 times default resolution which is close to retina display ppi (218-254 depending on model)\n  # https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202471\n  width = 480 * 3, height = 480 * 3, res = 72 * 3\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![with_png output](rendered/withpng-example.png)\n\nAnswer: code example above.\n\nAR Solutions: To control the graphics device we use `pdf()` and `dev.off()`. To ensure a clean termination `on.exit()` is used.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_pdf <- function(code) {\n  pdf(\"test.pdf\")\n  on.exit(dev.off(), add = TRUE)\n  code\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n5.  We can use `on.exit()` to implement a simple version of `capture.output()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncapture.output2 <- function(code) {\n  temp <- tempfile()\n  on.exit(file.remove(temp), add = TRUE, after = TRUE)\n  sink(temp)\n  on.exit(sink(), add = TRUE, after = TRUE)\n  force(code)\n  readLines(temp)\n}\n\ncapture.output2(cat(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", sep = \"\\n\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCompare `capture.output()` to `capture.output2()`. How do the functions  differ? What features have I removed to make the key ideas easier to see? How have I rewritten the key ideas so they're easier to understand?\n\nAnswer: `capture.output2()` has fewer features and uses two separate calls to `on.exit()`. It simply returns the output (by line) from the executed code, and highlights the key idea, using `sink()` to capture output to a temporary file.\n\nAR Solutions: Using `body(capture.output)` we inspect the source code of the original `capture.output()` function: The implementation for `capture.output()` is quite a bit longer (39 lines vs. 7 lines).\n\nIn `capture_output2()` the code is simply forced, and the output is caught via `sink()` in a temporary file. An additional feature of `capture_output()` is that one can also capture messages by setting `type = \"message\"`. As this is internally forwarded to `sink()`, this behaviour (and also `sink()`'s `split` argument) could be easily introduced within `capture_output2()` as well.\n\nThe main difference is that `capture.output()` calls print.\n\n---\n\n## 6.8.6 Exercises\n\n1.

We need to take care to not use the `+` operator itself inside of the function definition, as this would lead to an undesired infinite recursion. We also add `b = 0L` as a default value to keep the behaviour of `+` as a unary operator, i.e. to keep `+ 1` working and not throwing an error.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n`+` <- function(a, b = 0L) {\n  if (is.character(a) && is.character(b)) {\n    paste0(a, b)\n  } else {\n    base::`+`(a, b)\n  }\n}\n# Test\n+1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"a\" + \"b\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] \"ab\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Return back to the original `+` operator\nrm(`+`)\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n6.

This chapter dives deep into environments, describing their structure in depth, and using them to improve your understanding of the four scoping rules described in Section 6.4. Understanding environments is not necessary for day-to-day use of R. But they are important to understand because they power many important R features like lexical scoping, namespaces, and R6 classes, and interact with evaluation to give you powerful tools for making domain specific languages, like dplyr and ggplot2.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 7.2.7 Exercises\n\n1.

The second option would return two objects at the same time. What data structure would they be contained inside?\n\n---\n\n5.

If `where()` finds the name in one of these environments, it returns the environment's name. Otherwise, it throws an error.\n\nOur modified version of `where()` will always recurse until it reaches the empty environment. No matter if it has already found the name or not. Along the way, it will check each environment for the given `name`. Finally, it will return a list of environments where the binding was found; if no binding was found, the list will be empty.\n\nPlease also note how the list is initialised via the default argument, when the function is called for the first time. This is a bit confusing, which is why it's common to wrap a recursive function inside another, more user friendly, function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhere2 <- function(name, env = caller_env(), results = list()) {\n  if (identical(env, empty_env())) {\n    # Base case\n    results\n  } else {\n    # Recursive case\n    if (env_has(env, name)) {\n      results <- c(results, env)\n    }\n    where2(name, env_parent(env), results)\n  }\n}\n# Test\ne1a <- env(empty_env(), a = 1, b = 2)\ne1b <- env(e1a, b = 10, c = 11)\ne1c <- env(e1b, a = 12, d = 13)\nwhere2(\"a\", e1c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [[1]]\n#> <environment: 0x16822abf0>\n#> \n#> [[2]]\n#> <environment: 0x1680cbf90>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n2.

How is `search_envs()` different from `env_parents(global_env())`?\n\nAnswer: `search_envs()` includes the global environment. `env_parents(global_env())` doesn't include the global environment and also returns the empty environment (the top parent).\n\nAR Solutions: `search_envs()` returns all the environments on the search path, which is \"a chain of environments containing exported functions of attached packages\" (from `?search_envs`). Every time you attach a new package, this search path will grow. The search path ends with the base-environment. The global environment is included, because functions present in the global environment will always be part of the search path.\n\n`env_parents(global_env())` will list all the ancestors of the global environment, therefore the global environment itself is not included. This also includes the \"ultimate ancestor\", the empty environment. This environment is not considered part of the search path because it contains no objects.\n\n---\n\n2.

The function author __signals__ conditions with functions like `stop()` (for errors), `warning()` (for warnings), and `message()` (for messages), then the function user can handle them with functions like `tryCatch()` and `withCallingHandlers()`. Understanding the condition system is important because you'll often need to play both roles: signalling conditions from the functions you create, and handle conditions signalled by the functions you call.\n\nR offers a very powerful condition system based on ideas from Common Lisp. Like R's approach to object-oriented programming, it is rather different to currently popular programming languages so it is easy to misunderstand, and there has been relatively little written about how to use it effectively. Historically, this has meant that few people (myself included) have taken full advantage of its power. The goal of this chapter is to remedy that situation. Here you will learn about the big ideas of R's condition system, as well as learning a bunch of practical tools that will make your code stronger.\n\nI found two resources particularly useful when writing this chapter. You may also want to read them if you want to learn more about the inspirations and motivations for the system:\n\n* [_A prototype of a condition system for R_](https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/exceptions/simpcond.html) by Robert Gentleman \n  and Luke Tierney. This describes an early version of R's condition system. \n  While the implementation has changed somewhat since this document was \n  written, it provides a good overview of how the pieces fit together, and \n  some motivation for its design.\n\n* [_Beyond exception handling: conditions and restarts_](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html)\n  by Peter Seibel. This describes exception handling in Lisp, which happens \n  to be very similar to R's approach. It provides useful motivation and \n  more sophisticated examples. I have provided an R translation of the \n  chapter at <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/beyond-exception-handling.html>.\n\nI also found it helpful to work through the underlying C code that implements these ideas. If you're interested in understanding how it all works, you might find [my notes](https://gist.github.com/hadley/4278d0a6d3a10e42533d59905fbed0ac) to be useful.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 8.2.4 Exercises\n\n1.

It then calls `message(\"a\")`, which is caught by (2), which calls `message(\"b\")`. `message(\"b\")` isn't caught by anything, so we see a `b` on the console, followed by `a`. But why do we get another `b` before we see `c`? That's because we haven't handled the message, so it bubbles up to the outer calling handler.\n\n---\n\n4.

If a condition is signalled, it's caught and returned. If no condition is signalled, execution proceeds sequentially and the function returns `NULL`.\n\nThe current version of `catch_cnd()` is a little more complex because it allows you to specify which classes of condition you want to capture. This requires some manual code generation because the interface of `tryCatch()` provides condition classes as argument names.\n\n---\n\n5.

Inside a package you often need to stop with an error when something\n    is not right. Other packages that depend on your package might be\n    tempted to check these errors in their unit tests. How could you help\n    these packages to avoid relying on the error message which is part of\n    the user interface rather than the API and might change without notice?\n\nAnswer: return custom error objects that aren't dependent on the error text (like in 8.5.3)\n\nAR Solutions: Instead of returning an error it might be preferable to throw a customised condition and place a standardised error message inside the metadata. Then the downstream package could check for the class of the condition, rather than inspecting the message.\n\n---\n\n## 8.6.6 Exercises\n\n1.

Errors are not printed, but are returned, invisibly.\n\nAR Solutions: In general, we would like to catch errors, since they contain important information for debugging. To suppress the error message and hide the returned error object from the console, we handle errors within a `tryCatch()` and return the error object invisibly:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressErrors <- function(expr) {\n  tryCatch(\n    error = function(cnd) invisible(cnd),\n    interrupt = function(cnd) {\n      stop(\"Terminated by the user.\",\n        call. = FALSE\n      )\n    },\n    expr\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter we defined the error handling, we can just combine it with the other handlers to create `suppressConditions()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsuppressConditions <- function(expr) {\n  suppressErrors(suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(expr)))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo test the new function, we apply it to a set of conditions and inspect the returned error object.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The messages/warnings/conditions are suppressed successfully\nerror_obj <- suppressConditions({\n  message(\"message\")\n  warning(\"warning\")\n  abort(\"error\")\n})\nerror_obj\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> <error/rlang_error>\n#> Error:\n#> ! error\n#> ---\n#> Backtrace:\n#> ▆\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n2.  Compare the following two implementations of `message2error()`. What is the\n    main advantage of `withCallingHandlers()` in this scenario? (Hint: look\n    carefully at the traceback.)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmessage2error <- function(code) {\n  withCallingHandlers(code, message = function(e) stop(e))\n}\n\nmessage2error2 <- function(code) {\n  tryCatch(code, message = function(e) stop(e))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnswer: `message2error()` shows the invocation of `message()` in the traceback, but\n`message2error2()` does not.\n\nAR Solutions: Both functions differ in the way conditions are handled. `withCallingHandlers()` creates a *calling handler*, which is executed from within the signalling function. This makes it possible to record a detailed call stack, which helps us identify the signalling condition.\n\n`tryCatch()` defines an *exiting handler*, which means that the signalling function is terminated as soon as a condition is raised. It also returns control to the context where `tryCatch()` was called.\n\nIn this example the use of `withCallingHandlers()` returns more information than the use of `tryCatch()`. This allows us to determine the exact call that raised the condition.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmessage2error1 <- function(code) {\n  withCallingHandlers(code, message = function(e) stop(\"error\"))\n}\n\nmessage2error1({\n  1\n  message(\"hidden error\")\n  NULL\n})\n#> Error in (function (e) : error\ntraceback()\n#> 9: stop(\"error\") at #2\n#> 8: (function (e)\n#>    stop(\"error\"))(list(message = \"hidden error\\n\",\n#>      call = message(\"hidden error\")))\n#> 7: signalCondition(cond)\n#> 6: doWithOneRestart(return(expr), restart)\n#> 5: withOneRestart(expr, restarts[[1L]])\n#> 4: withRestarts({\n#>        signalCondition(cond)\n#>        defaultHandler(cond)\n#>    }, muffleMessage = function() NULL)\n#> 3: message(\"hidden error\") at #1\n#> 2: withCallingHandlers(code,\n#>      message = function(e) stop(\"error\")) at #2\n#> 1: message2error1({\n#>        1\n#>        message(\"hidden error\")\n#>        NULL\n#>    })\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmessage2error2 <- function(code) {\n  tryCatch(code, message = function(e) (stop(\"error\")))\n}\n\nmessage2error2({\n  1\n  stop(\"hidden error\")\n  NULL\n})\n#> Error in value[[3L]](cond) : error\ntraceback()\n#> 6: stop(\"error\") at #2\n#> 5: value[[3L]](cond)\n#> 4: tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])\n#> 3: tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)\n#> 2: tryCatch(code, message = function(e) (stop(\"error\"))) at #2\n#> 1: message2error2({\n#>        1\n#>        message(\"hidden error\")\n#>        NULL\n#>    })\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n3.  How would you modify the `catch_cnds()` definition if you wanted to recreate\n    the original intermingling of warnings and messages?\n\nAnswer: as noted in\n[Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/conditions.html#applications-1),\n\"It looks like Hadley wrote a part of the chapter after the exercises, as the `catch_cnds()`\nfunction defined in the chapter already solves this problem by storing all messages and warnings in\ntheir original order within a list.\"\n\n---\n\n4.  Why is catching interrupts dangerous?

There's no way to break out of the function because we're capturing the interrupt that you'd usually use!\n\n---\n",
