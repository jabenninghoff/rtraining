# Introduction

This workbook includes answers and solutions to the quizzes and exercises from [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) and [Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io), organized by chapter. It includes excerpts from both books, copied here.

**WARNING, SPOILERS!** If you haven't read Advanced R and intend to complete the quizzes and exercises, don't read this notebook. It contains my (potentially wrong) answers to both.
