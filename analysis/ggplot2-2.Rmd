# Introduction

This workbook includes answers and solutions to the quizzes and exercises from [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) and [Solutions to ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book-solutions-3ed.netlify.app), organized by chapter. It includes excerpts from both books, copied here.

**WARNING, SPOILERS!** If you haven't read the ggplot2 book and intend to complete the quizzes and exercises, don't read this notebook. It contains my (potentially wrong) answers to both.
