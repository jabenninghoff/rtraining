# About

My notes and experiences learning R and RStudio, bundled as an R package (work-in-progress). The package is currently not yet fully functional, but you can read my [R Training Log](r-training-log.html) and [R Setup Log](r-setup-log.html) using the GitHub Pages URL: <https://jabenninghoff.github.io/rtraining/>.
