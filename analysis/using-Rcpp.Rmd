Notes on using [Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org) to implement
[Poker-Hand-Evaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator) in the
[cards](https://jabenninghoff.github.io/cards/) package.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# no libraries
```

# Background

Rcpp provides an interface to C++, which allows
[rewriting R code in C++](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html) to improve performance. The cards
package implements functions that simulate dealing and evaluating poker hands in R and PH Evaluator
using python via [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). Will the C++ version of PH
Evaluator be faster?

The [Thirteen Simple Steps for Creating An R Package with an External C++ Library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-libraries.pdf)
vignette provides good high-level guidance on integrating a C++ library into an R package using base
R; additional work is needed to implement Rcpp using roxygen2.

# Test Build

To start, I followed PH Evaluator's
[instructions](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/tree/master/cpp) to build and test
the `pheval` library, which required installation of `cmake` using Homebrew (`brew install cmake`).

# Example Function

As a next step, I implemented a simple example function to ensure Rcpp was working properly. After
some research, I added the following code:

```cpp
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

//' Leading NA
//'
//' This function returns a logical vector identifying if
//' there are leading NA, marking the leading NAs as TRUE and
//' everything else as FALSE.
//'
//' Code from [Rcpp and Roxygen2](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/08/rcpp-and-roxygen2/).
//'
//' Installed with help from [usethis::use_rcpp()] and roxygen2 instructions on
//'   [Rcpp](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html#rcpp).
//'
//' Steps to install:
//'
//' 1. Create `src/leading_na.cpp` (this file)
//' 1. Run [usethis::use_rcpp()], add `@importFrom Rcpp sourceCpp` and
//'    `@useDynLib cards, .registration = TRUE` to `package.R` as directed
//' 1. Run [desc::desc_normalize()] and [devtools::document()]
//'
//' @param x An integer vector
//' @export
// [[Rcpp::export]]
LogicalVector leading_na(IntegerVector x) {
  int n = x.size();
  LogicalVector leading_na(n);

  int i = 0;
  while((i < n) &&(x[i] == NA_INTEGER)) {
    leading_na[i] = TRUE;
    i++;
  }
  return leading_na;
}
```

After the first two steps,
[`devtools::document()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/document.html) automates the addition
of the `leading_na()` function, R documentation, and Rcpp support to the package.
