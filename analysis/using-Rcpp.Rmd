Notes on using [Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org) to implement [Poker-Hand-Evaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator) in the [cards](https://jabenninghoff.github.io/cards/) package.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# no libraries
```

# Background

Rcpp provides an interface to C++, which allows
[rewriting R code in C++](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html) to improve performance. The cards
package implements functions that simulate dealing and evaluating poker hands in R and PH Evaluator
using python via [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). Will the C++ version of PH
Evaluator be faster?

The [Thirteen Simple Steps for Creating An R Package with an External C++ Library](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-libraries.pdf)
vignette provides good high-level guidance on integrating a C++ library into an R package using base
R; additional work is needed to implement Rcpp using roxygen2. The source code for the
[Corels](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=corels) package referenced in the vignette can be found
on GitHub: <https://github.com/corels/rcppcorels>.

# Test Build

To start, I followed PH Evaluator's
[instructions](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/tree/master/cpp) to build and test
the `pheval` library, which required installation of `cmake` using Homebrew (`brew install cmake`).

# Example Function

As a next step, I implemented a simple example function to ensure Rcpp was working properly. After
some research, I added the following code:

```cpp
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

//' Leading NA
//'
//' This function returns a logical vector identifying if
//' there are leading NA, marking the leading NAs as TRUE and
//' everything else as FALSE.
//'
//' Code from [Rcpp and Roxygen2](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/08/rcpp-and-roxygen2/).
//'
//' Installed with help from [usethis::use_rcpp()] and roxygen2 instructions on
//'   [Rcpp](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html#rcpp).
//'
//' Steps to install:
//'
//' 1. Create `src/leading_na.cpp` (this file)
//' 1. Run [usethis::use_rcpp()], add `@importFrom Rcpp sourceCpp` and
//'    `@useDynLib cards, .registration = TRUE` to `package.R` as directed
//' 1. Run [desc::desc_normalize()] and [devtools::document()]
//'
//' @param x An integer vector
//' @export
// [[Rcpp::export]]
LogicalVector leading_na(IntegerVector x) {
  int n = x.size();
  LogicalVector leading_na(n);

  int i = 0;
  while((i < n) &&(x[i] == NA_INTEGER)) {
    leading_na[i] = TRUE;
    i++;
  }
  return leading_na;
}
```

After the first two steps,
[`devtools::document()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/document.html) automates the addition
of the `leading_na()` function, R documentation, and Rcpp support to the package.

# Stub Function

As a next step, I implemented a stub function with help from
[Rcpp for everyone](https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/), specifically the chapter on
[Data types](https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/070_data_types.html):

```cpp
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

//' Evaluate a poker hand using PH Evaluator
//'
//' Evaluate the rank category of a five card poker hand using
//'   [PH Evaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator).
//'
//' Currently implemented as a stub function that always returns "poker_hand".
//'
//' @return string hand rank
//' @export
// [[Rcpp::export]]
String eval_hand_phe() {
  return "poker_hand";
}
```

The stub works, and suggests an approach for a first implementation using Rcpp: create a function
that calls `phevaluator::EvaluateCards()` and returns a string based on `Rank.category()` or
`Rank.describeCategory`, following
[`cpp_example.cc`](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/blob/master/cpp/examples/cpp_example.cc). A more complete implementation would use
[Rcpp Modules](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-modules.pdf) to expose
the C++ classes and methods in PH Evaluator, with help from the
[RcppStudent](https://github.com/coatless-r-n-d/rcpp-modules-student) R package.

Additional examples implementing C++ libraries in Rcpp I found include
[RcppAnnoy](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppannoy), written by Rcpp author and maintainer Dirk
Eddelbuettel, [rxylib](https://github.com/R-Lum/rxylib), and
[RcppSundials](https://github.com/AleMorales/RcppSundials.R).

## Add Headers

To start the first implementation, I added the headers from `cpp_example.cc`:

```cpp
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

#include <phevaluator/phevaluator.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>

//' Evaluate a poker hand using PH Evaluator
//'
//' Evaluate the rank category of a five card poker hand using
//'   [PH Evaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator).
//'
//' Implemented following
//'   [`cpp_example.cc`](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/blob/master/cpp/examples/cpp_example.cc)
//'   and [RcppAnnoy](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppannoy).
//'
//' Currently implemented as a stub function that always returns "poker_hand".
//'
//' @param hand a hand of cards (an integer vector of length 5).
//' @return string hand rank.
//' @export
// [[Rcpp::export]]
String eval_hand_phe(IntegerVector hand) {
  // phevaluator::Rank rank = phevaluator::EvaluateCards(hand[0], hand[1], hand[2], hand[3], hand[4]);
  // return rank.describeCategory();
  return "poker_hand";
}
```

To get the updated code to compile, I had to add `src/Makevars`, which I copied from RcppAnnoy, and
also added the `cpp/include` directory from PH Evaluator to `inst/`.

`src/Makevars`:

```Makefile
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I../inst/include/
```

While this code compiled, to get the commented code working, I'd need to add the code from
`cpp/src`. Just dumping the files from PH Evaluator into `src/` didn't work, but the rxylib
[`Makevars`](https://github.com/R-Lum/rxylib/blob/master/src/Makevars) file offered a clue: adapt
the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/blob/master/cpp/Makefile) from PH
Evaluator to the R `Makevars` format to properly build the library objects. Put another way, follow
how rxylib translated
[`xlib/Makefile.am`](https://github.com/wojdyr/xylib/blob/master/xylib/Makefile.am) to `Makevars`.
The Stack Overflow
[question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43597632/understanding-the-contents-of-the-makevars-file-in-r-macros-variables-r-ma)
referenced in rxylib provided additional details on the `Makevars` file format.

# Full Implementation

After some experimentation, I added the following files from PH Evaluator's `cpp/src` to `src/`:

```
7462.c
dptables.c
evaluator5.c
evaluator5.cc
hash.c
hash.h
hashtable.c
hashtable5.c
rank.c
tables.h
tables_bitwise.c
```

These were the minimal files needed to support the first implementation, which only had to support
evaluation of 5 card hands.

I also added a line to `src/Makevars` to enable the C++ 17 standard used by PH Evaluator:

```Makefile
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I../inst/include/
CXX_STD = CXX17
```

This *nearly* compiled, but failed with an error:

```
   duplicate symbol '_evaluate_5cards' in:
       /Users/agamemnon/GitHub/cards/src/evaluator5.o
       /Users/agamemnon/GitHub/cards/src/evaluator5.o
```

Ultimately this error was the result of two files with the same name but different file extensions
(`evaluator5.c` and `evaluator5.cc`). Renaming `evaluator5.c` to `evaluator_5_c.c` fixed the issue,
and the code below compiled and tested properly!

```cpp
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

#include <phevaluator/phevaluator.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>

//' Evaluate a poker hand using PH Evaluator
//'
//' Evaluate the rank category of a five card poker hand using
//'   [PH Evaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator).
//'
//' Implemented following
//'   [Rcpp-libraries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-libraries.pdf),
//'   PH Evaluator
//'   [`cpp_example.cc`](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/blob/master/cpp/examples/cpp_example.cc),
//'   and [RcppAnnoy](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppannoy), with help from
//'   R-Bloggers [Rcpp and Roxygen2](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/08/rcpp-and-roxygen2/),
//'   [usethis::use_rcpp()], roxygen2 instructions on
//'   [Rcpp](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html#rcpp),
//'   [Rcpp for everyone](https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/), the rxylib
//'   [`Makefile`](https://github.com/R-Lum/rxylib/blob/master/src/Makevars) and
//'   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43597632/understanding-the-contents-of-the-makevars-file-in-r-macros-variables-r-ma).
//'
//' `eval_hand_phe` returns one of the rank categories "Straight Flush", "Four of a Kind",
//'   "Full House", "Flush", "Straight", "Three of a Kind", "Two Pair", "One Pair", or "High Card".
//'
//' "Royal Flush" and "Jacks or Better" are not currently supported.
//'
//' @param hand a hand of cards (an integer vector of length 5).
//' @return string hand rank.
//' @examples
//' hand <- deal_hand(new_deck())
//' print_hand(hand)
//' eval_hand_phe(hand)
//' @export
// [[Rcpp::export]]
String eval_hand_phe(IntegerVector hand) {
  phevaluator::Rank rank = phevaluator::EvaluateCards(hand[0], hand[1], hand[2], hand[3], hand[4]);
  return rank.describeCategory();
}
```

After this, I removed the example function, added a C/C++ benchmark, and published cards 0.3.0.

## Follow-up

I did some additional research, and there doesn't seem to be a simple way to change R to compile using `filename.cc.o` instead of `filename.o`, as it goes against the intent of the R developers,
as described in this Stack Overflow
[article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23414448/r-makevars-file-to-overwrite-r-cmds-default-g-options):

> The clear recommendation on r-devel (please check the archives) is that you should avoid Makefile
logic if you can. IIRC this echoed in the Writing R Extension manual.

So, it seems the right answer is to rename the files to avoid this conflict. Additionally, after
reading a tidyverse blog post on
[New CRAN requirements for packages with C and C++](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/03/cran-checks-compiled-code/),
I learned that the R C++ standard was now C++17, so I technically did not need that line in the
`Makevars` file, but I decided to keep it as it was an upstream requirement.

I also discovered an example [package](https://github.com/coatless-r-n-d/rcpp-headers-subdirs) that
explained how to put code in a subdirectory of `src/`, which I plan to use for the second version
using Rcpp Modules.

I later added a script to copy (or update) the PH Evaluator source and header files to the cards
package, to automate future updates if needed.

After reading through the
[Creating R Packages](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-exts/Creating-R-packages.html) chapter
of [Writing R Extensions](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-exts/) and evaluating my options,
I am inclined to use a simple approach to creating a "phevaluator" package, copying the necessary
files into `src/` (with a shell script for reproducibility), use a minimal `Makevars` file, and use
[Rcpp Modules](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-modules.pdf) to expose
the C++ classes and methods in PH Evaluator, following the approach used by the
[RcppStudent](https://github.com/coatless-r-n-d/rcpp-modules-student) R package.
