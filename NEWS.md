## New Features

* major update: `build-site` has been replaced with an R function, `build_analysis_site()`, which retains all of the functionality of the old shell script. It is still considered Experimental, due to lack of test coverage and some features that are not implemented, but should work for projects with limited pkgdown customization. The update also includes a function to convert notebooks to `html_document`, `to_document()`.

* `build_analysis_site()` will be migrated to [rdev](https://jabenninghoff.github.io/rdev/) in a future release
