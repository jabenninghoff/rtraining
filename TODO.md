# TODO

*Inspired by <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/TODO.md>*

- [x] Implement site builder for a collection of notebooks leveraging the [rmarkdown site generator](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html), [render_site](https://rdrr.io/cran/rmarkdown/man/render_site.html)
- [ ] Add problems and solutions to the training log, including how to get around the limitation that you can't debug R Notebooks. (considered and rejected the knitr-spin.R approach)
- [ ] Add notes on resolving the error message generated by `use_package("tidyverse")`
- [ ] Write a utility/maintenance function to verify: `renv::status`, `renv::clean`, and possibly `renv::update` - see <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/R/status.R>
- [ ] Write a utility function to sort `.Rbuildignore`
- [ ] Review <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/> for ideas to include here
- [ ] Review <https://github.com/jimbrig/rtraining/> for ideas to include here
- [ ] Add notes from <https://r-pkgs.org> 
- [ ] Refactor site builder as an R function ?
- [ ] Implement [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) ?
