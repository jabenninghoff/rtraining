# TODO

*Inspired by <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/TODO.md>*

## Content

- [x] Add R Setup notebook
- [x] Add problems and solutions to the training log, including how to get around the limitation that you can't debug R Notebooks. (considered and rejected the knitr-spin.R approach)
- [ ] Add notes from <https://r-pkgs.org>
- [ ] Add notes on resolving the error message generated by `use_package("tidyverse")`
- [ ] Update README.Rmd
- [ ] Convert R Setup notebook to a vignette

## Package

- [x] Write wrapper functions to `styler` and `lintr` all files: the package, README.Rmd, and notebooks directory
- [x] Write a utility/maintenance function to verify: `renv::status`, `renv::clean`, and possibly `renv::update` - see <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/R/status.R>
- [x] ~~Write a utility function to sort `.Rbuildignore`~~
- [x] Migrate utility functions to [rdev](https://github.com/jabenninghoff/rdev)
- [x] Integrate `build-site` and pkgdown using custom navbars
  - Implement [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org)
  - Rename notebooks/ to analysis/, `build-site` in a subdirectory (docs/analysis)
- [ ] Review <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/> for ideas to include here
- [ ] Review <https://github.com/jimbrig/rtraining/> for ideas to include here
- [ ] Refactor site builder as an R function
  - wrapper for `rmarkdown::render_site()`
  - run the build in a temporary directory like `render_site()`
  - re-use code from `render_site()` to create list of R Notebooks
  - dynamically build the `_site.yml` file using [yaml](https://github.com/viking/r-yaml/) with configuration settings passed to the wrapper function
  - dynamically build the `index.Rmd` using `DESCRIPTION`
  - support for additional links in the navbar
  - order links by Title, not filename
  - better logic for converting `html_notebook` to `html_document`
- [ ] Migrate site builder to rdev

## GitHub

- [x] Implement site builder for a collection of notebooks leveraging the [rmarkdown site generator](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html), [render_site](https://rdrr.io/cran/rmarkdown/man/render_site.html)
- [x] Update `DESCRIPTION` and use description data in `README.Rmd`
- [x] Set up [GitHub Actions](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github_actions.html)
  - [x] Use [standard](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/check-standard.yaml) `R CMD check`
  - [x] Use [lintr](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/lint.yaml)
- [ ] Add GitHub Action for html/link checking using something like [htmlproofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer)
- [ ] Run [test coverage](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/test-coverage.yaml)
- [ ] Switch to  [full](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/check-full.yaml) `R CMD check` ?
- [ ] Autobuild `docs/` like [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/pkgdown.yaml) ?
