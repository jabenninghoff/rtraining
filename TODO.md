# TODO

*Inspired by <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/TODO.md>*

- [ ] Add problems and solutions to the training log, including how to get around the limitation that you can't debug R Notebooks. (considered and rejected the knitr-spin.R approach)
- [ ] Add notes on resolving the error message generated by `use_package("tidyverse")`
- [ ] Write a utility/maintenance function to verify: `renv::status`, `renv::clean`, and possibly `renv::update` - see <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/R/status.R>
- [ ] Write a utility function to sort `.Rbuildignore`
- [ ] Review <https://github.com/rstudio/renv/> for ideas to include here
- [ ] Review <https://github.com/jimbrig/rtraining/> for ideas to include here
- [ ] Add notes from <https://r-pkgs.org>
